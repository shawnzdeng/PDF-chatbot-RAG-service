    "file_description": "The file is a set of lecture notes titled Machine Learning from Malla Reddy College of Engineering & Technology, designed for a final-year B.Tech course. It provides a comprehensive overview of machine learning fundamentals, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning; common models like decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines; ensemble methods; probabilistic models; and genetic algorithms. The material emphasizes both theoretical foundations (e.g., PAC learning, VC dimension) and practical applications.",
    "example_questions": [
      "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
      "Can you explain how decision trees work?",
      "What are the key components of a neural network?",
      "How does reinforcement learning differ from other types of machine learning?",
      "What is the purpose of ensemble methods in machine learning?"
